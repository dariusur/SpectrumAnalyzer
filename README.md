# SpectrumAnalyzer
SpectrumAnalyzer is a FPGA based real-time audio spectrum analyzer. It measures the magnitude of an input audio signal versus frequency. The sound waves are converted into an electrical signal via a microphone and then sampled by the FPGA. The sampled data is used to perform Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) which converts a time domain audio signal into frequency domain. At the end, the processed data is sent to PC via USB and displayed on screen with the help of a Python script.

## Implementation details
BlueTachometer uses a hall sensor to detect presence of a magnetic field. A magnet with its south pole facing the hall sensor is mounted on the rotating object that is to be measured. A south pole of sufficient strength turns the output on. Removal of the magnetic field turns the output off. Hall sensor output gives a digital signal and is open-drain. Upon activation it pulls the line LOW (active LOW signal). An external pullup resistor is used to pull the line HIGH when the hall sensor is deactivated. The measurement of the signal is performed by the MCU which executes the program shown in Fig. 3. To get a better visual understanding, Fig. 4 shows how the MCU measures the signal step by step. Essentially, the MCU measures the period of the signal. This is done by using a timer to increment a counter register. When the timer is stopped the MCU sends the counter value via UART to the Bluetooth module. The data is then transmitted to PC. Knowing the CPU clock frequency, the counter value can be converted to time (signal period) by calculating the CPU clock period and multiplying it by the counter value $T_{signal} = f_{cpu} * counter$. The signal frequency can be calculated by taking the inverse of the signal period $f_{signal} = T_{period}$. Finally, RPM can be obtained by multiplying the signal frequency by 60. All of this can be expressed in a simple formula $RPM = {f_{cpu} \over counter} * 60$. This is the equation that is used in the DataVisualizer script.

### DataVisualizer
DataVisualizer script uses 4 libraries:
1. pyserial for communication with HC-05.
2. matplotlib for data plotting.
3. numpy for temporary data storage in numpy array.
4. pandas for data export to .csv.

Firstly, the script tries to open a serial port over Bluetooth to receive data from HC-05. If it succeeds, then the graph is configured (figure, labels, grid, etc). After that, an empty graph is displayed, and the script enters a loop and waits for data. The received data is converted to RPM and displayed on screen. Finally, after closing the figure window (click X), the script asks if data should be saved to .csv.

## Specifications
* RPM measurement range: 0.017 to 9000000 RPM.

|Resolution|RPM|
|---|---|
|<5|18972|
|<1|8486|
|<0.5|6000|
|<0.1|2683|

* Data rate = 125 samples per second (5000 bits/s)

Resolution depends on CPU clock frequency (1.2 MHz). The greater the frequency, the larger RPM values can be measured, but at a cost of resolution. This characteristic is illustrated in Fig. 5. The graph shows that there are two limits, one is the $f_{cpu}$ limit, which represents the greatest possible RPM value that can be measured. This limit could only be reached if MCU would perform the measurement on every clock cycle. However, instructions take time to execute, and in worst case scenario it takes 4 clock cycles to perform the measurement. This brings us to the other, measurement algorithm limit, which represents the greatest RPM value that the MCU can actually measure. Even though it is possible to measure up to 9000000 RPM, the resolution is so bad that the error is in the order of 100000s of RPM. In addition, there is one more limit which is not shown, which is the 32 bit timer limit, which sets the lowest possible RPM value that can be measured, which is 0.017.

## Issues and notes for further development
* Currently there is a reliability issue, because there is no mechanism to track and prevent data loss during transmission. In addition there is no checking which byte of the four byte data packet is being read. When the first byte is being read, it is only assumed that it is the first byte. This leads to incorrect calculation of RPM. It seems like this issue can be avoided if the script is first started and only then the measurement is performed. The only time when this issue was observed is when the script is started during measurement.
* Measures only every other signal period. This issue comes from the fact that Attiny13 has only one timer and it is used for both the measurement and UART communication. If there were at least two timers, then one timer could be dedicated solely for measurement, and instead of stopping, it could simply be reset and continue to measure during communication.
* Data rate is slow. The communication speed could be improved if a greater baud rate was used. Also, pyserial read() function takes quite a significant time to execute (15-32 ms).
